            <p>
              Are you in the Five County area of North Carolina and struggling
              to find a Gospel of Grace based, Holy-Spirit filled community of
              believers? We are a few believers meeting regularly on Sundays for
              worship and fellowship together and would love for you to join us.
              Maybe you live too far away to get together regularly but would
              still like the support of knowing you're not alone. Either way,
              please contact us, we would love to hear from you.
            </p>

              Below is a list of resources we have enjoyed and use often. We
              feel that they give a far better insight into what we personally
              believe about the Gospel than a formal statement of faith could.
